									<h2><a name="assessment">Assessment of physics courses at SCCC</a></h2>

									   <h4> Description of assessment process since 2012</h4>

									       <p>Physics belongs to the following program at SCCC: <a href="deptdocs/LASprograms.pdf">Liberal Arts and Sciences: Science Emphasis/A.S. Degree</a>.<br>
								
									       <p>Original information about the program (2012): <a href="deptdocs/Program_info.pdf">Mission Statement, Goals and Program Learning Outcomes (PLO)</a>.</p>
									       <p>To assess a program, we assess the PLOs. In 2017, we reached the conclusion that different disciplines inside our program needed to take their own path of assessment, and customize the PLO list. Current <a href="deptdocs/PLOForm_PHY.pdf">PLO</a> list adjusted to the discipline of Physics (2017).</p> 
									
									       <p>Next, we need to map how each PLO is linked to the Course Learning Outcomes (CLO) listed in the general syllabus of each course. This is how we choose which physics course will be assessed. <a href="deptdocs/physics_maps_PLO_CLO.pdf">Physics curriculum map PLO &#8596; CLO</a> (2013).<br>
									 
									       <p>It is also important for the institution as a whole to understand how our PLOs match the Institutional Educational Goals (IEG). <a href="deptdocs/physics_maps_2017_PLO_IEG.pdf">Physics curriculum map PLO &#8596; IEG</a> (2017).</p>

									       <h4>5-Year Plans</h4>
									       
							     		<p>This is the <a href="deptdocs/physicsFYPLAN.pdf">original physics 5-year assessment plan for the period Fall 2013 - Spring 2018</a>. Changes have been implemented to years 4 and 5, to adapt to the adjustment occurred in 2017 to list of PLOs for physics (see above).</p>
									<p> <a href="deptdocs/Physics_5Yplan_2019.pdf">Physics 5-year assessment plan for the period Fall 2018 - Spring 2023</a>. </p>

									<h2><a name="share">Sharing teaching material</a></h2>
								
                                                                        <p>In the link below you will find a compilation of presentation slides, homework assignments, extra credit assignments, laboratory instructions, information about textbook and other teaching materials available for our physics courses at SCCC. This material is to be shared amongst SCCC faculty only. Please do not share the link with our students, this is only for faculty. If you would like to contribute with some material, please send it my way and I will post it.</p>
									<p>The link below requires username and password. Please write to denicolo AT sunysuffolk.edu.</p>
									
									<center><a href="http://gdenicolo.net/facultyshare/facultyshare.html"><Img src="images/collaboration.svg" height=50px title="teaching materials to share"></img></a></center>

									 <h2><a name="new">Are you new to SCCC?</a></h2>

									 <h4>New to the department</h4>

									 <p>These are my tips to give you a more wholesome view about working at SCCC:<br>

									 <p>Please get familiarized with the department website (<a href="https://www.sunysuffolk.edu/explore-academics/majors-and-programs/science/">https://www.sunysuffolk.edu/explore-academics/majors-and-programs/science/</a>), and check-out the list of physics courses offered.</p>

									 <p>Access MySCCC, click Academics, then Faculty Services (link on the left): rosters and student advisement menu are there. Under student advisement menu, you can enter a student name, and look at their SAIN report. Concerning class rosters, there are several: enrollment verification roster (to be completed on a certain deadline, which is around the 4th week of a semester), the final grade roster, and there's also a handy photo roster available on a previous link (MySCCC &#x2192; Academics &#x2192; look in the central panel for "Access Photo/Download Rosters"). </p>

									 <p>Communication with students should follow <a href="https://www.sunysuffolk.edu/legalaffairs/services/ferpa.jsp">FERPA</a> rules. Essentially, avoid communicating grades and other perfomance-specific information via telephone, or with someone else besides the student in the case. You can actually communicate performance information via e-mail, but <i> it must be done to a student's college authenticated @sunysuffolk.edu e-mail address</i> (not @gmail, @yahoo, etc). You can find a student's e-mail address in MySCCC &#x2192; Academics &#x2192; Faculty &#x2192; Faculty Services &#x2192; Student Advisement Menu &#x2192; Student E-mail Address (remember to always use @sunysuffolk.edu for important exchange of information). You can e-mail a whole classroom by going: MySCCC &#x2192; Academics &#x2192; Faculty &#x2192; Faculty Services &#x2192; Class Roster (select term and class code "CRN", then scroll to the bottom of the list of names, and click on "Display Email List"). 

									 <p> While teaching at SCCC,  you will need to submit a "Leave Report" online, every month. The path to access your Leave Report is:  MySCCC &#x2192; Academics &#x2192; Faculty &#x2192; Faculty Services &#x2192; click on the "Employee" tab at the top. Unless you have missed a day of work, you can just click "Submit for Approval". Talk to the department chair if you have questions.

									 <p>Promotion information & forms, salary schedules, benefits, sabbatical, professional development grants, the contract, and lots of other fun stuff can be found at the <a href="http://www.fascc.org">Faculty Association website</a>. We pride ourselves on having a strong union representation. College committees, Senate/Congress/Assembly, advisory boards and etc that you might want to serve on in the future (a good thing for promotion), can be found at the <a href="https://www.sunysuffolk.edu/governance/">Governance page</a>. Practically every department (or area) has a representative in governance, and a rep at the faculty association: search for your reps, it's good to know.<br>

									   <h4>About teaching physics</h4>
								     
									   <p>You will find that most of us are happy to share our classroom material with other instructors: all you have to do is ask. But you should get your own copy of any adopted textbook asap, by writing to a publisher representative and asking for a desk copy, for example. <br>
									   <p>If there's one thing we really really share is all the lab material & instructions.<br>
									   <p> This is an advice given to me when I started: lecture less, practice more with the students in class. In summary, this practice would be: solving problems together with their participation and input, or working on interactive demonstrations or experiments. Interactive engagement activities are more important and effective than lecturing. There is a lot of literature on this, and a good initial source would be <i>The Physics Teacher</i> (TPT) publication by the <i>American Association of Physics Teachers</i> (AAPT). Publications before 2010 are freely available online, newer ones require purchasing access. You get free access if you become a member of AAPT (highly recommended). But your colleagues  at SCCC (me!, for example) have copies of these magazines and other publications, ask first! <br>
									   <p> An advice I think is important: establish firm rules on the first day of class. Grading policy, attendance policy, withdrawal policy, perhaps a code of conduct for students (address plagiarism and cheating), and make sure to explain your expectations for the course. Physics is likely to require a very different way of studying (more time practicing, not memorizing) than all other courses the students have taken before: they are often shocked after the first test. Therefore, this first day conversation with students is crucial (give yourself about one hour, or even the whole class time). Stay consistent until the end of the semester. I write it all down in my course outlines, hand those in the first day of class, and as a contract, I ask students to read and sign the course outline during the first week of classes.
									   <p>Finally, please attend national and/or regional meetings/conferences: we learn so much outside our small world of physics at SCCC. The college <a href="faculty.html#travel">covers about $2200 (this number increases every few years, you must check with your department chair, or secretary to get in touch with the people who know; incredibly it has always been hard to find online the correct amount up-to-date; <a href="https://fascc.org/professionalmatters/conference-attendance">here's the Faculty Association page about it</a>) per 24 months for travels: use it</a> (this is for full-time faculty). There are other funds available at SCCC, check out here for <a href="http://www.fascc.org/professionalmatters/faculty-development-retraining">full-time</a> and <a href="http://www.fascc.org/adjuncts/professional-development">adjunct faculty</a>, and remember that conferences often offer travel grants too.  Get familiar with the <a href="http://www.aapt.org">AAPT website</a>, but of course there are other societies out there, such as <a href="https://www.aps.org">APS</a>, <a href="https://aas.org">AAS</a>, etc. Yes, a conference trip will be less expensive if you join a membership organization for about $200 a year (you will get meeting discounts, and free publications). Again, concerning publications related to physics education, the AAPT publication <a href="http://www.aapt.org/Publications/tpt.cfm"> The Physics Teacher (TPT)</a> is perfect for us.
