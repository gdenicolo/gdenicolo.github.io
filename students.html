									<h2><a name="advisement">Are you taking the correct physics course?</a></h2>

									<p>When comparing requirements, never focus your attention only on the name of a course: don't trust names, there is no uniformity on how courses are labeled. "College Physics" can mean different things for different institutions. Instead, pay attention to the detailed description that explains the pre- and co-requisites, and most importantly, the list of topics covered.</p>
									<p>Also, never go by the number of courses required: different institutions split physics coverage in different ways. Some courses can be much more demanding and fast-paced than others, and it is difficult to compare just by looking at superficial information. Again, instead, pay attention to the detailed description, pre/co-requisites and list of topics covered. At SCCC, for example, our calculus-based physics sequence takes 3 semesters (6 courses in total, lecture+lab).</p>
									<p> Ultimately, the physics course(s) you take depends on what you want to do in the future:

									<ul>
									  <li><b>Aspiring ultrasound technicians, radiology technicians, occupational therapists</b>: <a href="students.html#courses">PHY103</a> should be the course for you at SCCC (only basic algebra is required). Most programs in these areas have accepted PHY103 in the past, but <i>you</i> need to call or e-mail the institution you want to transfer to, and confirm officially that PHY103 will be accepted. E-mail might be better, as you will have official proof of their reply. Checking ahead that this is the right course for your career goal is <bs>your responsibility</bs>.</li>
									  &nbsp;<br>
									  <li><b>Aspiring physical therapists</b>: the sequence of courses <a href="students.html#courses">PHY118 and PHY119</a> should be appropriate for you at SCCC (2 semesters). This is intermediate algebra and trigonometry-based physics (only pre-calculus is required), and it is generally accepted for <i>non-science majors</i> (<i>notice this is more mathematically demanding than PHY103, and has a different emphasis and coverage than PHY103</i>). Most non-science major programs have accepted PHY118/119 in the past, but you need to call or e-mail the institution you want to transfer to, and confirm officially that PHY118/119 will be accepted.</li>   
									  &nbsp;<br>
									  <li><b>All majors in the life sciences (biology, environmental sciences/forestry)</b>: the general rule is that you need the 2-semester sequence of calculus-based physics at SCCC : <a href="students.html#courses">PHY121, PHY122</a>.</li>
									  &nbsp;<br>
									  <li><b>All majors in: engineering, computer science, math, physical sciences</b>: the general rule is that you need the 3-semester sequence of calculus-based physics at SCCC: <a href="students.html#courses">PHY130+PHY132, PHY220+222, PHY230+PHY232</a>. Sometimes there are exceptions: some science programs might accept PHY118/119, but it is <i>your responsibility</i> to check. <b>ATTENTION: once you start taking the calculus-based sequence at SCCC, you should avoid transferring until you complete all 3 semesters.</b> Transferring after only 1 or 2 semesters will most likely result in missing a full semester of physics at the institution you are going to (a waste of your time and money). Only the full package of 3 semesters transfers seamlessly. This is because different institutions split the coverage of topics in different ways. Only after 3-semesters we are all the same.</li>

Some are the big scholarships (several thousand dollars), for example <a href="http://department.sunysuffolk.edu/StayonLongIslandScholarships/index.asp"><b>SOLII</b></a>, and the math department "Dr. Robert Frey Family Foundation" scholarship. But most of the scholarships listed award $100-500, and very few students typically apply, sometimes none! So you can imagine your chances of getting some of these are high. <b>Apply to all that you are eligible for!</b></p>

Students typically send applications to 10 places or more, and perhaps hear back positively from only one: that's the ratio, in general. Therefore, apply to many!

									 <h2><a name="why">Why take physics?</a></h2>

									 <p>Physics is about explaining the laws of nature. It opens your mind to a different way to thinking and solving problems from the root up, based on principles and laws, adapting to the different scenarios as you go, without relying much on memorization. This technique can be applied to many jobs and areas of life. Physics will give you "eureka!" moments, when you finally understand something you never fully understood before. It is highly valued by employers, and it has so many applications...but do not register to a physics course unless you are willing & able to spend many hours practicing it. Practice and dedication is what it takes, there's no mystery. The internal brain process is like learning a new language, or learning how to swim: you cannot do it just by looking at a book, and it will require time to get good at it.

									 <h2><a name="success">What does it take to succeed in physics?</a></h2>
									
									 <p>Different from many other courses, physics is not about memorization. Every problem is different, and so you must adapt every time. We will teach you tools to solve problems, but every problem will ask you to use these tools differently. We will practice together in class, but that is not enough. You will need to practice a lot more (3 times more than the time spent in class, per week) on your own. The internal brain process is like learning a new language, or learning how to swim: you cannot do it just by looking at a book or how a professor solved something, you must try it yourself, several times, in different ways. It will require time to get good at it. Do not register to a physics course unless you are willing & able to spend many hours practicing it.</p>

									 <p><b>Advice for students who REALLY want to succeed in college and beyond.</b></p>
									 <p>Do not compare yourself to students near you: the environment outside SCCC is more competitive than inside SCCC, and you will need to establish higher standards for yourself. Take charge of your own academic path, do not wait for counselors/advisors to tell you what courses you need to take: investigate on your own, search for information online, study the sample schedule of the institution you plan to transfer to. For example, you can find sample schedules from Stony Brook university <a href="http://sb.cc.stonybrook.edu/bulletin/current/academicprograms/"><bs>here</bs></a> (click on a discipline, and "Sample Course Sequence"). Ask questions directly to a faculty member who teaches the discipline of interest. Knock on doors, send e-mails, ask questions, plan ahead: BE PROACTIVE. Apply to all internships/scholarships available and of interest; aim at spending all your summers at an internship. If you are working for money during the summers, aim at jobs that offer valuable skills to add to your academic cv, such as management/business, communication/outreach, leadership skills: put that in your cv, or letter of intent/personal statement. When it is time to transfer, apply to many institutions, being prepared to hear "yes" from only a few of them, because it is a very competitive world out there. Do not apply to only "famous" institutions, apply to several "back-up plan" smaller institutions. Needless to say, many insitutions have different forms of financial aid or scholarships to cover tuition: apply to all of that too at the same time. You will learn that no matter where you go, the biggest difference for your future is your passion, not the institution.</p>
									 <p><b>You are always going to need recommendation letters.</b></p>
									 <p>When requesting a recommendation letter, get in touch with the faculty member well ahead of the deadline (MORE THAN 2 WEEKS NOTICE, PREFERABLY A MONTH OR MORE). Only request recommendation letters from faculty members that have something really positive to say about you (something that distinguishes you from others). In the e-mail you send to the faculty member requesting the letter, remember to <bs>state clearly the deadline, the name and address of the institution(s) you are applying to, explain what program(s) you are applying to, attach cv, and preferably attach a letter of intent</bs> too (so that the faculty member can read about your goals for the future, what you would like to do, and some reason why: the more information we have, the stronger the letter). And good luck!</p>
