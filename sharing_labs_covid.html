	<h2><a name="RC"> RC constant using voltmeter</a></h2>

	<p><b>General description</b>: students will collect data from video, plot the voltages for when capacitor is charging and discharging, fit the linearized plots, obtain RC constant from the slope, and compare values. You can have a discussion about how measurements are averaged by the DMM; how the capacitor is always discharging through the circuit; that the internal resistance of the battery is more relevant when the current is higher: these are all sources of errors. Class: PHY232 (second-semester of calculus-based physics).</p>
      
        <p><b><a href="RC_voltmeter.mp4">Video</b></a> for the following data collection: C, R, V_R, V_C, time. </p>
      
        <p><b><a href="RC_voltmeter.xlsx">Spreadsheet for instructor</b></a>. You can use this to demonstrate the general outcome to students. Notice different tabs at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet, some have parts blacked out so that they can be used in video demonstrations for students. My explanations are recorded, and I don't want students stopping the video to copy my data when there is an opportunity for them to collect data on their own (using the video above). </p>

        <p><b><a href="Lab6.pdf">Instructions</b></a>: this is the handout given to students. It always needs to be tweaked, it's an endless job. </p>

<!--	<p><b><a href=".pdf">Slides</b></a>: this is supporting information in PowerPoint slides (here as PDFs) that I can use during explanations, for visual aid or to speed up an explanation.</p> -->

	<h2><a name="RCRL"> RC and L/R constants using oscilloscope<a></h2>

	<p><b>General description</b>: students will collect data from video, organize the data in tables, show calculations to determine RC and L/R, and compare experimental and expected values. Class: PHY232 (second-semester of calculus-based physics).</p>
      
        <p><b><a href="RC_RL_oscilloscope.mp4">Video</b></a> for the following data collection: C, R, L, R_L, t_1/2 for circuit with capacitor, t_1/2 for circuit with inductor. </p>
      
        <p><b><a href="RC_RL_oscilloscope.xlsx">Spreadsheet for instructor</b></a>. I would not show this to students, as the handout with instructions (below) suffices to explain what's required. However, you probably want to provide the students with the uncertainties at the scales used to measure Delta_t (given in spreadsheet). </p>

	<h2><a name="Rectifiers">Rectifiers</a></h2>

	<p><b>General description</b>: students will collect data from video, organize the data in table(s), show calculations to demonstrate how RMS is calculated for different signals, and compare against averages. Only a half-wave rectifier is used in this lab. Class: PHY232 (second-semester of calculus-based physics).</p>

	<h2><a name="qm">Electron charge/mass ratio</a></h2>

	<p><b>General description</b>: students will collect data from video, organize the data in table(s), present average charge/mass ratio for electron. Error propagation, standard deviation required. Class: PHY232 (second-semester of calculus-based physics).</p>
      
        <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rj8oBFU5Eo&feature=youtu.be">Video</b></a> (by Maggie Geppert, Harper College) for the following data collection: V_accel, I, R_electron. Students will need to use one of the following to collect R_electron from the video: a) video analysis with LoggerPro (if they already have experience with it, or you will need to do a crash course); or b) video analysis with <a href="https://physlets.org/tracker/">Tracker</a> (again, if they have experience, or you will need to provide a crash course); or (c) simply get still frames from the video to get scaled measurements (demonstrated in this <a href="charge_mass.pptx">slide</a>). In all cases, students will use the information from the <a href="manufacturer.pdf">manufacturer</a> for calibration of the scale on the video: the diamater of the glass sphere is 16 cm.</p>
      
        <p><b><a href="lab_charge_mass.xlsx">Spreadsheet for instructor</b></a>: this is the result of my video analysis with tracker. You can show to students, if you want, as an example of what can be acheieved. </p>

        <p><b><a href="Lab9.pdf">Instructions</b></a>: the isntructor can modify this, or insert its own. The data available was taken for a rather fixed V_accel. </p>

	<h2><a name="res">Resonance curve</a></h2>

	<p><b>General description</b>: students watch video to understand how measurements were collected. The bulk of the data is provided to students, but they will need to collect values of R, L, C etc from video. The general purpose is to plot the resonance curve for Vr/emf and phase difference against frequency, and compare experiment to theory (there is no fitting here, just superposing of the theory). Class: PHY246 (third-semester of calculus-based physics).</p>
      
        <p><b><a href="Resonancecurve.mp4">Video</b></a> for the following data collection: R_L, R, C, L, emf, and the value of the experimental resonance frequency.
	  
        <p><b><a href="resonance.xlsx">Spreadsheet for instructor</b></a>, and a tab of raw data for students. Instructors can show their own spreadsheet while explaining the lab, to demonstrate what students are expected to achieve, and to discuss experimental errors involved. Notice that parasitic capacitance is a problem here.</p>

	<h2><a name="RCfilter">RC filter circuit</a></h2>

	<p><b>General description</b>: students watch video to understand how measurements were collected. The bulk of the data is provided to students, but they will need to collect values of R, C etc from video. The general purpose is to plot the gain curve by graphin Vr/emf, and the the phase difference, versus frequency, and compare the data points to theory (not a fit, just superpose the theory). For extra points I ask for RMS and R^2 values for the comparison of curves experiment versus theory. Class: PHY246 (third-semester of calculus-based physics).</p>
      
        <p><b><a href="RCfiltercircuit.mp4">Video</b></a> for the following data collection: R, C, emf.
	  
        <p><b><a href="RCfilter.xlsx">Spreadsheet for instructor</b></a>, and a tab of raw data collected for the student. Instructors can show its own spreadsheet while explaining the lab, to demonstrate what students are expected to achieve.</p>

	<h2><a name="string">Standing waves on string</a></h2>

	<p><b>General description</b>: Students can collect all information necessary from video, although not a lot of proper measurement is required in the video, it's more a matter of watching and collecting data. The general purpose is to calculate the speed of propagation using standing waves, and compare with the speed of propagation using the formula for speed of wave on string. Class: PHY246 (third-semester of calculus-based physics).</p>
      
        <p><b><a href="Standingwaves.mp4">Video</b></a> for the following data collection: mass, length, frequency of vibrator, resonances, hanging masses and uncertainties, length of vibrating string.
	  
        <p><b><a href="standingwaves.xlsx">Spreadsheet for instructor</b></a>. Students have all the information needed in the instructions below and the video, no need to share or show the instructor's spreadsheet. </p>

	<h2><a name="sound">Speed of sound in air</a></h2>

	<p><b>General description</b>: Students will calculate the speed of sound in air using the lengths of the air column, while in resonance with a tone generator installed on the phone (any free app). The experiment is perfomed for 3 different frequencies. Class: PHY246 (third-semester of calculus-based physics).</p>
      
        <p><b><a href="speedofsound.mp4">Video</b></a>: I tried to record a video where students could collect data from, but it got too complicated for the short amount of time available. Therefore, the video only provides the general idea. The data has been collected for the students, and given in a spreadsheet.
	  
        <p><b><a href="speedofsound.xlsx">Spreadsheet for instructor</b></a> and there is a tab to give to students. </p>

	<h2><font color=#FF0000>What's needed next, but we have no access to materials anymore:</font></h2>

	<p>I welcome suggestions of videos/simulations/data for the following labs for calculus-based physics:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><p>Measuring magnetic fields, or the law of induction. The instructions I have focused on Earth's mag field, but at this point I welcome any material. In fact, I am inclined to use Vernier's video analysis on Faraday's law here as a substitute. </p></li>

	<li><p>Measuring electron charge/mass: I hope this data/video will come from M. Geppert.</p></li>

	<li><p>Formation of images using lenses and mirrors. There are several simulations online, I am aware of them, but would need to dig for something with instructions to be completed by students, for example, to make it more challenging and interactive for them (and a bit less work for me if I can find something prepared).</p></li>

	<li><p>Double and single-slit diffraction. I could dismantle my lab final test and get the students to measure fringe distances on a diffraction pattern printed on a piece of paper. I'm always striving to make things a bit more interactive, I guess. Maybe I'll just have to give up. </p></li>

	<li><p>A thermodymanics lab. The instructions I have focused on mechanical equivalent of heat, I also have instructions for calorimetry labs, but without access to the materials (and having already spent enough money on college stuff, believe me) I am not willing to purchase more things, even if cheap, to improvise these. I'm hoping to use resources from other colleagues...thanks everyone in advance...</p></li>
